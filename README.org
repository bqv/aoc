And it was without form, and emptiness was upon the face of the reflog...

**** DONE Day 1
And on the first day, there was *Rust*. He saw the Rust, and it was good.
**** DONE Day 2
And on the second day, he divided the /functional/ from the /imperative/, and called the /imperative/ *Go*.
**** TODO Day 3
And on the third day, he said "let there be /dynamicism/ in the midst of the web", and it was so, and he called the /dynamicism/ *PHP*.
