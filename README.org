In the beginning, he created the repository...

And it was without form, and emptiness was upon the face of the reflog...

And His Caret moved upon the face of the sources...

**** DONE Day 1
And on the first day, there was *Rust*. He saw the Rust, and it was good.
**** DONE Day 2
And on the second day, he divided the /functional/ from the /imperative/, and called the /imperative/ *Go*.
**** DONE Day 3
And on the third day, he said "Let there be /dynamicism/ in the midst of the web", and it was so. And he called the /dynamicism/ *PHP*.
**** DONE Day 4
And on the fourth day, he said "Let the /whitespace/ under the source be gathered unto one place, and let arcane /characters/ appear, and it was so. And he called the /characters/ *Perl6* and the /whitespace/ unnecessary.
**** DONE Day 5
And on the fifth day, he brought *Smalltalk*, and /object/ yielding /message/ after it's kind, and /message/ yielding /object/, who's /message/ was in itself, after it's kind.
